THESIS TITLE : Telecom churn prediction using logistic regression
ABSTRACT : The telecommunication industry faces an ongoing battle against customer churn,which hampers profitability and growth.The thesis delves deep 
             into the realm of churn prediction by employing the powerful logistic regression algorithm.Through the application of advanced feature engineering
             techniques,the thesis explores novel insights and offers a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics behind customer attribution.
DATASETS USED : customer data, churn data
DATASOURCE : The dataset used for this project is sourced from kaggle.It provides a comprehensive collection of customer information,including demographics,usage
             patterns,and churn labels.
TECHNOLOGIES USED : 1)Python- The primary programming language
                    used for data analysis,model development and
                    implementation.
                    2)Pandas- A poweful library of data manipulation
                    and analysis.
                    3)NumPy- A fundamental library for scentific 
                    computing with python.
                    4)Scikit-learn- A comprehensive machine learning
                    library that provides effecient tools for model training,
                    evaluation,and prediction.
                    5)Matplotlib and seaborn- Libraries for Data visualization and 
                    generating informative plots.
 PROJECT OVERVIEW : DATA COLLECTION AND PREPROCESSING-
                    Gathering customer data from various sources and preparing it from analysis by handling missing values,Encoding categorical variables,
                    and performing feature scaling.
                    EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS-
                    Conducting in-depth analysis to understand the characteristics of churned and non-churned customers, identifying trends,and extracting
                    meaningful insights.
                    FEATURE ENGENEERING-
                    selecting and engeneering relevant features that capture customer behaviour,usage patterns,demographics,and other factors that influence
                    churn.
                    MODEL DEVELOPMENT-
                    Implementing machine learning algorithms,such as logistic regression,to build a churn prediction model.Fine-tuning the model using cross 
                    validation and hyperparameter optimization techniques.
                    MODEL EVALUATION-
                    Assesing the performance of the churn prediction model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy,precision,recall,and f1 score.
                    Performing a comparative analysis of different models and techniques.
                    DEPLOYMENT AND INTEGRATION-
                    Deploying the trained model for real-time predictions or integrating it into existing systems to support churn management strategies.
